# Sandbox frontend

The sandbox frontend project is a how-to example for implementing a DDD application using [cubiche](https://github.com/cubiche/cubiche) library.

This project implements a conference management system, an example taken from the books "Microservices for everyone" (2017) by Matthias Noback and "Exploring CQRS and Event Sourcing" (2012) by Dominic Betts.

The project contains a frontend page and a dashboard application.
